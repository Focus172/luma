# Luma
## Building
Use cargo or the just file (which uses cargo)
there are no build or runtime *deps* other than rust

## Testing
run the **comanad**

[test](https://example.com)
```sh
cargo test
```

## Thanks
The biggest thanks has to go to the markdown crate as the fact that it even 
exists is crazy for how powerful it is.
Another thank you to jot for their work. I forked what they had for my use case
but it was still a good project.
